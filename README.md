# Fest-Registration-System
Built a , role-based event registration system where students can easily sign up for events and view their registrations after logging in. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly front-end and connected it to a back-end powered by SQL to handle storing and retrieving participant data. The goal was to make event management smooth, secure, and straightforward for both users and organizers.
